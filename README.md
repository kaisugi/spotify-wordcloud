Spotify WordCloud is an app that lets you create a word cloud from the names of your favorite artists.  
You can tweet the word cloud on the spot. You can also save the word cloud and look back at it later.

#### Learn more about creating word cloud images

This app retrieves the list of top artists from Spotify's "Get a User's Top Artists" API, combines them into a single string, and creates a word cloud based on it.  
The combined string is kept in the session. The image is placed in the `/tmp` folder with the hash of the string as the file name.  
URLs related to image creation will always try to refer to these cached information first. However, /regenerate does not refer to the `/tmp` folder, and creates the image again.
